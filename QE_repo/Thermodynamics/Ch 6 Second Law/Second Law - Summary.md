## Second Law - stated

The *second law of thermodynamics* states that processes occur in a certain direction, not in any direction. A process does not occur unless it satisfies both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Bodies that can absorb or reject finite amounts of heat isothermally are called *thermal energy reservoirs* or *heat reservoirs*.

## Efficiency
Work can be converted to heat directly, but heat can be converted to work only by some devices called *heat engines*. The **thermal efficiency** of a heat engine is defined as

$$\eta_{th} = \frac{W_{net,out}}{Q_H}= 1- \frac{Q_L}{Q_H}$$

where  $Q_H$ is the amount of heat supplied to the engine, and $Q_L$ is the amount of heat rejected by the engine

## Coefficient of Performance

Refrigerators and heat pumps are devices that absorb heat from low-temperature media and reject it to higher-temperature ones. The performance of a refrigerator or a heat pump is expressed in terms of the **coefficient of performance**, which is defined as

$$COP_R = \frac{Q_L}{W_{net,in}}=\frac{1}{Q_H/Q_L - 1}$$

$$COP_{HP} = \frac{QHL}{W_{net,in}}=\frac{1}{1-Q_L/Q_H}$$

## Kelvin-Planck statement

The *Kelvin–Planck statement* of the second law of thermodynamics states that no heat engine can produce a net amount of work while exchanging heat with a single reservoir only.

---
## Clausius statement

The *Clausius statement* of the second law states that no device can transfer heat from a cooler body to a warmer one without leaving an effect on the surroundings.

Any device that violates the first or the second law of thermodynamics is called a **perpetual-motion machine**

## Reversibility 

A process is said to be *reversible* if both the system and the surroundings can be restored to their original conditions. Any other process is *irreversible*. The effects such as friction, non-quasi-equilibrium expansion or compression, and heat transfer through a finite temperature difference render a process irreversible and are called *irreversibilities*.

## Carnot Cycle

The **Carnot cycle** is a reversible cycle that is composed of four reversible processes, two isothermal and two adiabatic. The Carnot principles state that the thermal efficiencies of all reversible heat engines operating between the same two reservoirs are the same, and that no heat engine is more efficient than a reversible one operating between the same two reservoirs. These statements form the basis for establishing a thermodynamic temperature scale related to the heat transfers between a reversible device and the high- and low temperature reservoirs by

$$\left(\frac{Q_H}{Q_L}\right) = \frac{T_H}{T_L}$$

Therefore, the $Q_H/Q_L$ ratio can be replaced by $T_H/T_L$ for reversible devices, where $T_H$ and $T_L$ are the absolute temperatures of the high- and low-temperature reservoirs, respectively.

### Reversable efficiency 

A heat engine that operates on the reversible Carnot cycle is called a Carnot heat engine. The thermal efficiency of a Carnot heat engine, as well as all other reversible heat engines, is given by

$$\eta_{th,rev} = 1 - \frac{T_L}{T_h}$$

This is the maximum efficiency a heat engine operating between two reservoirs at temperatures $T_H$ and $T_L$ can have.

### Coefficient of performance - Reversible 

The $COP$s of reversible refrigerators and heat pumps are given in a similar manner as

$$COP_{R,rev} = \frac{1}{T_H/T_L -1}$$

$$COP_{HP,rev} = \frac{1}{1-T_L/T_H}$$

Again, these are the highest $COP$s a refrigerator or a heat pump operating between the temperature limits of $T_H$ and $T_L$ can have.
