# Density and Specific Gravity
* ***Density:** $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$
	* $\frac{kg}{m^3}$
* **Specific Volume:** $\bar V=\frac{V}{m}=\frac{1}{\rho}$
	* That is, specific volume is *volume per unit mass*
* **Specific Gravity:** $SG = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{H_2O}}$
	* $\rho_{H_2O} = 1000\frac{kg}{m^3}$
* **Specific weight:** $\gamma_s =\rho g$
	* $\frac{N}{m^3}$
	* $g:$ is the gravitational acceleration

# Processes and Cycles
* **Isothermal:** Temperature, $T$, remains constant
* **Isobaric:** Pressure, $P$, remains constant
* **Isochoric (isometric):** specific volume remains constant
* **Cycle:** is a process for which the initial and final states are identical
