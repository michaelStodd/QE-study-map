## 2 Forms of Energy
* **total energy:** $E$, includes all forms of energy
	* $e\equiv \frac{E}{m}$ is energy per unit mass
* **internal energy:** the sum of all the *microscopic* forms of energy
	* *micro:* forms of energy related to the molecular structure
	* *macro:* forms of energy for the entire system 
* **mass flow rate:** $\dot m=\rho \dot V\approx \rho A_c V_{avg}$  Given some assumptions
	* $\left[\frac{kg}{s}\right]$
* **Energy flow rate:** $\dot E = \dot me$
	* $\left[\frac{kJ}{s} \right] = [kW]$ 
* **sensible energy:** the portion of internal energy of a system associated with the kinetic energies of the molecules
* **latent energy:** the internal energy associated with the phase of a system 
* **chemical energy:** internal energy associated with the atomic bonds in a molecule
* **Heat transfer:** energy interaction is heat transfer if its driving force is a temperature difference
* **Work:** if its not heat transfer, then its work

# 3 Energy Transfer by Heat
* **Heat:**  is the form of energy that is transferred between two systems by virtue of a temperature difference
* **adiabatic process:** process during which there is no heat transfer
	* Occurs when systems are sufficiently insulated
	* or, all elements are at the same temperature
* **Heat transfer:** $Q$
	* $q\equiv \frac{Q}{m} \hspace{0.5cm}\left[ \frac{kJ}{kg} \right]$ 
* **Heat transfer rate:** $\dot Q$
	* $Q=\int \dot Q dt$
	* $Q=\dot Q \Delta t$

# 4 Energy Transfer by Work
* **Work:** $W$, is also a form of energy transferred like heat
	* $w \equiv \frac{W}{m} = \left[ \frac{kJ}{kg} \right]$
